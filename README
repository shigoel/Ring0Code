This repository contains some very simple kernel sub-routines/programs
that will be used to exercise the ACL2-based x86isa reasoning
framework (see books/projects/x86isa on https://github.com/acl2/acl2).

By design, these system programs are much simpler (and less efficient,
less complete, etc.) than the in-use kernel code. Using these programs
as verification targets in the "System-level Mode" of the x86isa
framework will give an idea of what to expect when verifying in-use
kernel code later.
